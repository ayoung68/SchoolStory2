# Bill Collection: Predict LATE from BILL

# Data
# The first 48 observations in the data set are residential accounts
# and the second 48 are commercial accounts.

# create type
overdue$type<-c(rep("residential",48),rep("commercial,48"))

#MODEL
#because we see different slopes for residential and commercial, the model
# will include an interaction
