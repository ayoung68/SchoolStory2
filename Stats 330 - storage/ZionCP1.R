#ANALYSIS

#if observed curvature in the series plot which is indicative of a multiplicative effect from year to year
#apply the log transformation to the multiplicative effect
#becomes additive

#Confirm the relationship appears more additive.

#Filter the data (due to World War II)

     ylab = "Log - Zion NP Annual Visitors (in millions)")

#The filtering to the 'recent past' improves agreement with the constant mean change consumption
#by ignoring the data containing the park visitor total during the 1940s (World War II). This also
#better reflects the future Zion tourism demand since the filtered data no longer has data which would be misleading for
#predicting the normal number of visitors without an unexpected change, following a more realistic pattern.
# all appears well

#Research Task and Data Features:
#One strength of the research was the filtering of the data, which smoothed the data out in order to make
#it more accurate for predicting the future. Another research data feature that matched the strength of the data was the ARIMA
#prediction for the next five years. According to the prediction, the Zion annual visitors will continue to increase at a positive, 
#steady rate.

#Analysis Weaknesses
#One weakness of the analysis was the prediction interval. Also, there were no explanatory variables, such as weather conditions, 
#cost to enter the park, and businesses/restaurants being built around the area.

#One research task is to predict the average/per game attendance for the Brooklyn Nets of the NBA for the next five years.
